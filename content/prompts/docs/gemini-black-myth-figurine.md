## Prompt Template
```
Please turn this screenshot of the game character into a character figure riding on an Asian tiger. Behind it, place a PlayStation game box printed with the character's image and the game title 'Black Myth: Zhong Kui.' Next to it, add a computer with its screen displaying the in-game scene, complete with the game's UI and the character. In front of the game box, add a round plastic base for the figure and have it stand on it. The PVC material of the base should have a crystal-clear, translucent texture, and set the entire scene indoors.
```

## Tips
1. Lock subject terms first (character name, tiger mount).
2. Iterate on lighting (studio vs warm indoor) to fine-tune PVC translucency.
3. Save successful variations as custom presets for other game characters.
