**Prompt 1**

Create a hyper-realistic editorial portrait of a person, generated from the provided image (same face 100%, same hairstyle, expression preserved). The subject stands confidently on a reflective glossy floor wearing a coordinated bright yellow and crimson outfit (hooded jacket or sweatshirt and tailored joggers) with lightning bolt-inspired linework and subtle embroidered electric motifs running along sleeves, chest and pant seams. Matching crimson and yellow sneakers complete the look. Beside the subject stands a large Pikachu-like creature, scaled to be equal to or taller than the person, with realistic textured fur and a vibrant palette of electric yellows and deep crimson accents that echo the clothing. Background is a moody electric yellow to deep crimson gradient that enhances the vibrant palette; both subject and creature are clearly reflected on the floor. Lighting uses dramatic warm key light and sculpting rim light to emphasize skin, fur and fabric detail, cinematic shallow depth of field, slight film grain for editorial grit, photoreal creature integration, ultra-detailed 8K quality.

**Prompt 2**

Hyper-realistic editorial portrait of a person, generated from the provided image (same face 100%, same hairstyle, expression preserved). The subject stands confidently on a reflective glossy floor wearing a coordinated fiery orange and cream outfit (hooded jacket or sweatshirt and tailored joggers) with flame-inspired linework and subtle embroidered draconic scale motifs running along sleeves, chest and pant seams. Matching cream and vibrant orange sneakers complete the look. Beside the subject stands a large Charizard, scaled to be equal to or taller than the person, with realistic textured scaly skin and a vibrant palette of fiery oranges and teal blue accents that echo the clothing. Background is a moody fiery orange to deep teal blue gradient that enhances the vibrant palette; both subject and creature are clearly reflected on the floor. Lighting uses dramatic warm key light and sculpting rim light to emphasize skin, scales and fabric detail, cinematic shallow depth of field, slight film grain for editorial grit, photoreal creature integration, ultra-detailed 8K quality.

Matching crimson red and deep purple sneakers complete the look. Beside the subject stands a large Gengar, scaled to be equal to or taller than the person, with a realistic smooth, almost ethereal texture, and a vibrant palette of deep purples with glowing crimson red eyes that echo the clothing. Background is a moody deep purple to shadowy black gradient that enhances the vibrant palette; both subject and creature are clearly reflected on the floor. Lighting uses dramatic cool key light and sculpting rim light to emphasize skin, form and fabric detail, cinematic shallow depth of field, slight film grain for editorial grit, photoreal creature integration, ultra-detailed 8K quality.

Beside the subject stands a large Gyarados, scaled to be equal to or taller than the person, with realistic textured hard scales and a vibrant palette of royal blues and cream accents with a red crest that echo the clothing.
